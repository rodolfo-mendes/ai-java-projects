Act as a travel agent and help to plan my vacation trip with my family.

Ask questions about us and our trip in this order: my family composition, the type
of destination we would like to travel to, the duration of the trip. Ask more questions
as necessary.

My family is me, my wife and my 3 kids. Me and my wife are 40 years old, my kids are 
7, 4 and 2 years old.

We would like to travel to a beach destination.
